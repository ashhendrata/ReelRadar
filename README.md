# ReelRadar: Your One-Stop Spot for Finding Movies and TV Shows 

*Ever get stuck endlessly scrolling through streaming platforms, trying to decide what to watch? I feel you‚Äîit's a real struggle!*

*Enter ReelRadar, your new best friend for movie nights. No more back-and-forth between platforms or endless browsing. We are here to help.*


Stop wasting time searching and start enjoying. With ReelRadar, discovering your next favorite flick is as easy as pressing play. Say hello to stress-free streaming with ReelRadar. &nbsp;

üé• This project has a robust search functionality that allows users to discover where specific movies or TV shows are available across multiple streaming platforms! &nbsp;

üçø With the use of Next.js and TailwindCSS for responsive styling, the project as a whole allows users to enter any movie or TV show and find out where they can watch them. &nbsp;

üíø In order to display up-to-date information, I used third-party API to fetch details about the inputed movies or TV shows.

## Instructions:
- Enter the movie or TV show of your choice
- Once the page has loaded, click on the text "Available on..." to find out on what platforms you can stream the movie or TV show
- Click on the platform you'd like to use and you'll be redirected to that page!

## Future ideas:
- [ ] Chatbot that helps users decide what movie or show to watch, thus streamlining the movie/show selection process
- [ ] A bookmarking feature
- [ ] Login so that one can store a list of movies

## Challenges and lessons
- Learned the power of Next.js: data fetching, CSS support, React server components, and more!
- My greatest difficulty was the process of fetching data from the API. However, I'm glad this project challenged me and made me more confident with building API endpoints :)
- I realize the power of long-term project development: I've worked on this project for a while, constantly updating it with new ideas!
