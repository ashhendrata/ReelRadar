# ReelRadar: Your One-Stop Spot for Finding Movies and TV Shows

This project has a robust search functionality that allows users to discover where specific movies or TV shows are available across multiple streaming platforms!
With the use of Next.js and TailwindCSS for responsive styling, the project as a whole allows users to enter any movie or TV show and find out where they can watch them.
In order to display up-to-date information, I used third-party API to fetch details about the inputed movies or TV shows.

## Instructions:
- Enter the movie or TV show of your choice
- Once the page has loaded, click on the text "Available on..." to find out on what platforms you can stream the movie or TV show
- Click on the platform you'd like to use and you'll be redirected to that page!

## Future ideas:
[] Chatbot that helps users decide what movie or show to watch, thus streamlining the movie/show selection process
[] A bookmarking feature
[] Login so that one can store a list of movies
